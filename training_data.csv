Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has stepped ⁠in to personally guarantee $40.4 billion in Paramount Skydance's latest effort to pry Warner Bros Discovery away from selling its prized Hollywood assets to streaming giant Netflix.The guarantee, disclosed in a filing on Monday, seeks to allay the Warner Bros board's doubts about Paramount's financing and the lack ‌of full Ellison ‌family backing, which had pushed it toward the competing cash-and-stock offer from Netflix.Warner Bros shares rose nearly 4%, while Paramount added about 3%. Warner Bros ‌and Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Paramount said the amended terms do not change the $30-per-share all-cash offer even as the fight for Hollywood's sought-after assets heats up, with control of Warner Bros' vast library offering a decisive edge in the streaming wars.""Paramount remains in a precarious position and is making a last-ditch effort to avoid being ​left out in the shadows,"" said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight. ""The improved ​offer is a step in the right direction, but it is unlikely to be enough.""As part of ‌the revised terms, ‍Ellison also agreed not to revoke the family trust or transfer its assets during ‍the pendency of the transaction, the filing showed.Paramount said it has raised its ‌regulatory reverse termination fee to $5.8 billion from $5 billion to match the competing transaction and extended the expiration date of its tender offer to January 21, 2026. The bid follows Warner Bros asking its shareholders to reject the $108.4 billion offer from Paramount for the whole company, including cable TV assets, on doubts over its financing and the lack of a full guarantee from the Ellison family. But Warner Bros investors, including the fifth largest shareholder Harris Associates, have said they would be open to revised offers from Paramount if it presents a superior ‍bid and addresses issues with deal terms.REGULATORY SCRUTINYFor either suitor, winning shareholder support is only the first hurdle, as both deals would face intense antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe.Lawmakers from ‍both parties have ⁠raised concerns about consolidation in the ⁠media industry, and U.S. President Donald Trump has said he plans to weigh in on the transactions.A Paramount-Warner Bros combination would create a studio larger than industry leader Disney and combine two major television operators, a move some Democratic senators say would give one company control over ""almost everything Americans watch on TV.""A Netflix-Warner Bros tie-up would cement Netflix's dominance in streaming, creating a group with a combined 428 million subscribers. Netflix has said it would honor Warner Bros' theatrical commitments and argued the deal would benefit consumers by lowering costs through bundled offerings.Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has said he is confident the deal would win regulatory approval, arguing it would avoid job cuts in an industry already struggling with uneven box-office returns.",ITC,ITC.NS,401.6000061035156,403.6499938964844,401.20001220703125,402.70001220703125,6847871,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Stock broking platform Groww on Monday said it has launched 'Groww Lite', a web-based emergency trading portal, to safeguard users during platform outages and technical glitches. The new portal enables users to close or exit their open trading positions even if the main Groww app or website is temporarily inaccessible during an outage, the stock broking platform said in a statement. The launch comes in the wake of recent large-scale internet disruptions, including a Cloudflare-related outage that impacted access to multiple digital services. By introducing Groww Lite, the company is creating a fail-safe channel for users to retain control over their trades during critical market hours, even under outages or technical glitches. The new trading platform is a secure, desktop and mobile web-based platform built specifically for emergency trade execution. Operating on a separate DNS infrastructure, it remains functional even when core platforms or external cloud services face disruption. ""We are continuously working to make our core platforms even more robust. Groww Lite is designed as a safety layer for our users, something they hopefully never need to use, but can depend on completely when they do,"" the company said in a statement.Groww Lite is designed for maximum resilience by bypassing Cloudflare and standard routing layers.

Domestic carrier IndiGo, which is being probed for massive operational disruption earlier this month, cancelled around 50 flights on Tuesday, according to the airline's website. The flights have been cancelled from across airports, including Mumbai, Delhi, Varanasi, Pune, Chandigarh, Amritsar, Indore, and Patna, among others. The airline, however, did not provide any reason for these cancellations. As part of its winter schedule, IndiGo was initially allowed to operate 15,014 flights per week or 2,144 per day on domestic routes, which was 6 per cent more compared to 14,158 flights per week it operated in the summer schedule of 2025. However, following massive disruptions in operations that led to the cancellation of thousands of flights and caused severe hardships to lakhs of air passengers in the country, the government slashed its winter schedule by 10 per cent, or 214 flights per day. Consequently, the airline cannot operate more than 1,930 flights per day, excluding international and cargo services. Following the large-scale flight cancellations, which at one point reached 1,600 in a single day, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) set up a 4-member probe panel to assess manpower planning, fluctuating rostering systems, and the airline's preparedness to implement the latest duty period and rest norms for pilots.The panel has already summoned and grilled IndiGo's two top officials, Chief Executive Officer Pieter Elbers and Chief Operating Officer Isidre Porqueras, and its report is expected by this week.",RELIANCE,RELIANCE.NS,1580.9000244140625,1580.9000244140625,1568.0999755859375,1570.699951171875,7506564,RELIANCE,2026-01-02,2155936.0,1592.0,1595,55.1,413.0,0.35,7.57,6.61,10.0,0

Vedanta Group Chairman Anil Agarwal on Tuesday highlighted silver's sharp rally in 2025, saying the metal has finally emerged from the shadow of gold and is entering what he described as a long-term structural phase driven by technology-led demand.In a post on social media platform X, Agarwal said silver has delivered a year-to-date appreciation of 125% in dollar terms, sharply outperforming gold, which has risen 63% during the same period. While acknowledging that gold has also had a strong year, Agarwal said silver's returns have been almost double, underscoring a shift in investor and industrial interest.Agarwal said the silver story is only the beginning, arguing that the metal occupies a unique position among commodities. According to him, silver is the only metal that combines intrinsic value with strong functional demand.He pointed to new technologies such as solar cells and defence equipment, where silver is a key input, as drivers of long-term demand. Agarwal added that as India's only silver producer, Vedanta Group is seeing this trend play out directly through its operations at Hindustan Zinc.""Prices will go up and down, but silver’s extraordinary shine is here to stay,"" Agarwal said in the post.The comments come at a time when silver has become an important profit driver for Vedanta Group, primarily through its flagship mining arm Hindustan Zinc. The company's latest financial results underline the growing role silver is playing alongside zinc in its earnings profile.For the quarter ended September 2025, Hindustan Zinc reported a consolidated profit after tax of Rs 2,649 crore, marking a 19% sequential increase. Silver alone contributed nearly 40% of the company’s overall profits during the quarter, translating to around Rs 1,060 crore. This highlights the strategic advantage the company enjoys as one of the world's top five silver producers.Silver revenue for the quarter stood at Rs 1,706 crore, up 10% quarter-on-quarter and 20% year-on-year. The sharp increase was driven by a combination of higher global prices and steady operational performance.

Reliance Industries,2025-12-24,"RVNL, IRCTC, Jupiter Wagons shares are running again. Should you ride railway stocks into the Union Budget?",Economic Times,"RVNL, IRCTC, Jupiter Wagons shares are running again. Should you ride railway stocks into the Union Budget?

Railway stocks are back in the spotlight just as 2025 winds down, with investors snapping up names that have struggled for much of the year. Shares of RVNL, IRCTC, Jupiter Wagons, RailTel, Texmaco Rail and Titagarh Rail staged sharp gains this week, pulling buyers into a sector now buzzing with pre-Budget speculation. The question investors are asking is if this is a sustainable turnaround, or just another pre-Budget spike?Jupiter Wagons led Tuesday’s charge, rising nearly 8% to Rs 335, followed by RailTel Corporation climbing 5.3% to Rs 360. RVNL gained 3% to Rs 342.60, while Titagarh Rail and Texmaco Rail edged up 2% and 1%, respectively. On Wednesday, profit-taking slightly trimmed these gains, though overall momentum remains strong.What’s driving the rally in railways stocks?Analysts said the surge is largely sentiment-driven. “The rally was initiated by the conversion of a preferential issue by the promoters of Jupiter Wagons, which triggered a sharp up move in the stock which in turn, spilled over into other EPC-focused railway businesses,” said Sunny Agrawal, head of fundamental research at SBI Securities.IRCTC also saw buying interest after Indian Railways announced a rationalisation of its fare structure effective December 26, while RailTel gained on reports of talks with Elon Musk-owned Starlink for a potential partnership in India. The moves follow a strong session on Monday, when several railway stocks jumped as much as 13% in afternoon trade.All eyes on the Union BudgetWith the Union Budget scheduled for February 1, market activity is picking up as investors anticipate possible increases in railway capex and infrastructure spend. Expectations for Budget 2026–27 include a potential 10–12% increase in railway allocations to around Rs 2.76 trillion, supporting new Vande Bharat sleeper trains and expanded safety systems.Fundamentals vs technicalsFrom a fundamentals standpoint, SBI Securities prefers wagon-related businesses, where structural demand is stronger. Agrawal recommended booking profits on any further pre-Budget rally, while retaining exposure to companies with sustainable growth drivers.Technically, IRCTC is trading above its 20-day SMA, providing key support at 675, according to Amol Athawale, VP, Technical Research, Kotak Securities. If it holds, the stock could climb to 700–710. Titagarh Rail, up over 6% in the past two sessions, shows potential upside to 870–880, provided it stays above 800.Caution remainsMarket experts warned that pre-Budget hype can be short-lived. “While a pre-Budget rally is a historical pattern, the market in 2026 will likely demand concrete evidence of improved margins and faster project commissioning before committing back to the sector at previous highs,” said Santosh Meena, Swastika Investmart.For now, railway stocks are back in play, but whether the rally continues post-Budget will depend on the allocation numbers and execution on the ground.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Reliance Industries,2025-12-29,The tenuous peace between Trump and the $30 trillion US bond market,Economic Times,"The tenuous peace between Trump and the $30 trillion US bond market

Since President Donald Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs pushed the U.S. bond market into revolt in April, his administration has carefully tailored its policies and messaging to prevent another flareup. But the truce remains fragile, some investors say. A reminder of that fragility came on November 5 when the Treasury Department signaled it was considering selling more long-term debt. The same day, the ‍Supreme Court began hearing arguments over the legality of Trump's sweeping trade tariffs. Benchmark 10-year bond yields, which have fallen steeply this year, spiked more than 6 basis points - one of the biggest jumps in recent months. With the market already uneasy about the size of U.S. federal deficit, the Treasury proposal stirred fears among some investors of upward pressure on long-dated bond yields. The Supreme Court case, meanwhile, raised doubts ⁠about a major source of revenue to service the $30 trillion pile of government debt held by the market. Citigroup analyst Edward Acton called the moment ""a reality check"" in a November 6 daily report. Reuters spoke to more than a dozen executives at banks and asset managers overseeing trillions of dollars in assets who said that beneath the relative calm of bond markets in recent months a battle of wills is playing out between the administration and investors concerned about the persistently high U.S. deficit and debt levels. Reflecting those worries, the so-called ""term premium"" - the extra yield investors demand for holding U.S. debt for 10 years - has once again started to rise in recent weeks. ""Bond markets' ability to terrify governments and politicians is second to none, and you've seen that in the U.S. this year,"" said Daniel McCormack, head of research at Macquarie Asset Management, referring to April's bond crash which forced the ‌administration to temper its plans for tariff increases. Over ‌the long term, the failure to resolve strains on public finances can create political issues as voters grow ""persistently disappointed with government delivery,"" McCormack said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent - a former hedge fund manager - has repeatedly said he is focused on keeping yields down, especially on the benchmark 10-year bond, which affects the cost of everything from the federal government's deficit to household and corporate borrowing. ""As Treasury Secretary, my job is to be the nation's top bond salesman. And Treasury yields are a strong barometer for measuring success in ‌this endeavor,"" Bessent said in a November 12 speech, noting borrowing costs were down across the curve. The Treasury did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Such public messaging and behind-the-scenes interactions with investors have convinced many in the market the Trump administration is serious about keeping yields in check. Some unwound bets over the summer that bond prices would fall after the Treasury proposed increasing purchases under an ongoing buyback program meant to improve market functioning, data shows. The Treasury has also discreetly sought investors' opinions on major decisions, with one person familiar with the matter describing them as ""proactive."" In recent weeks, the Treasury consulted with bond investors on five candidates for the Federal Reserve chair role, asking how the market would react to them, the person said. They were told it would react negatively to Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, because he is not perceived as independent enough from Trump. Several investors said they believed the Trump administration has merely bought itself time with such steps and, with the U.S. still needing to finance an annual deficit of around 6 percent of GDP, risks remain to peace in the bond market. The administration is keeping bond vigilantes - investors who punish government profligacy by driving up yields - at bay, but only just, these market experts said. Price pressures from tariffs, bursting of an artificial intelligence-led market bubble, and the prospect of an overly accommodative Fed pushing inflation higher could all upset the equilibrium, investors say. ""The bond vigilantes never go away. They're always there; it's just whether they're active or not,"" said Sinead Colton Grant, chief investment officer at BNY Wealth Management. THE VIGILANTES ARE WATCHING White House spokesman Kush Desai told Reuters the administration was committed to ensuring robust and healthy financial markets. ""Cutting waste, fraud, and abuse in ‌runaway government spending and cooling inflation are some of many ‍actions by this Administration that have increased confidence in the U.S. Government's finances and reduced 10-year Treasury yields by nearly 40 basis points in the past year,"" he said. The bond market has a history of punishing fiscally irresponsible governments, sometimes costing politicians their jobs. Most recently, in Japan, Prime ‍Minister Sanae Takaichi has grappled with keeping bond investors happy while trying to further her agenda. When Trump began his second term, several indicators watched by bond traders were flashing red: total U.S. government debt ‌stood at over 120% of annual economic output. Those worries flared after April 2 when Trump imposed massive tariffs on dozens of countries. Bond yields - which move inversely to prices - saw their steepest weekly rise since 2001, as bonds sold off alongside the dollar and U.S. stocks. Trump backed off, delaying the tariffs and ultimately imposing them at rates below what he initially proposed. As yields retreated from what he described as a queasy moment, he hailed the bond market as ""beautiful."" Since then, 10-year Treasury yields have fallen over 30 basis points, and a measure of bond market volatility has recently fallen to its lowest in four years. On the surface, it seems that bond vigilantes have gone silent. SIGNALS TO THE BOND MARKET One reason for the silence, the investors said, is the resilience of the U.S. economy, with massive AI-led spending offsetting the drag on growth from tariffs, and with a Fed in easing mode because of a slowing job market; another is the steps the Trump administration has taken that signal to the market that it doesn't want runaway yields. On July 30, the Treasury said it was expanding a buyback program that will reduce the amount of long-dated, illiquid debt outstanding. The buybacks are meant to make it easier to trade bonds, but because the expansion was focused on 10-, 20- and 30-year bonds, some market participants wondered whether it was an effort to cap those yields. The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a group of traders who advise the agency on debt, said there was ""some debate"" among its members whether it could be ""misconstrued"" as a way to shorten the average maturity of outstanding U.S. government bonds. The person who is familiar with the matter said some investors worried about the Treasury taking unconventional steps, such as an aggressive buyback program or reducing the supply of long-dated bonds, ‍to limit yields. As these discussions were going on over the summer, short positions - bets that long-dated Treasury bond prices would fall and yields would rise - fell, data shows. Short bets against bonds with at least 25 years of remaining term to maturity fell sharply in August. They have been ramping back up in the past few weeks. ""We're in this age of financial repression with governments using various tools to artificially keep a lid on bond yields,"" said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer of the Rockefeller Global Family Office, part of Rockefeller Capital Management, which manages $193 billion in assets, calling it an ""uneasy equilibrium"". The Treasury Department has ‍also taken other steps to support the market, such ⁠as leaning more heavily on short-term borrowing through Treasury bills to fund the deficit instead of increasing supply ⁠of long-dated bonds. It has also called on banking regulators to make it easier for banks to buy Treasury bonds. JPMorgan analysts have estimated that the supply of U.S. government debt issued to the private sector with a maturity longer than one year would decline next year compared to 2025, even if the U.S. budget deficit is expected to remain roughly unchanged. Demand for T-bills is expected to get a boost as well. The Fed has ended its balance sheet rundown, meaning it will be again an active buyer of bonds, particularly short-dated debt. And the Trump administration's embrace of cryptocurrencies has created a new significant buyer of such debt - stablecoin issuers. Bessent said in November that the stablecoin market, valued at around $300 billion, could grow tenfold by the end of the decade, increasing demand for Treasury bills. ""I feel like there's less uncertainty in the bond market; there's just more equalization in terms of supply and demand,"" said Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement Group. ""It's been a little odd, but it's worked so far."" The question for many market participants, however, is how long it can last. Meghan Swiber, senior US rates strategist at BofA, said the bond market's current stability relied on a ""tenuous balance"" of subdued inflation expectations and Treasury's reliance on shorter-maturity issuance, which has helped keep supply concerns in check. If inflation surges and the Fed turns hawkish, she said, Treasuries could lose their diversification appeal, rekindling demand concerns. The reliance on T-bills to fund the deficit also has risks, and some sources of demand such as stablecoins are volatile. Stephen Miran, the head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers who is currently serving as a Fed governor, criticized the Biden administration last year for the same approach Bessent is taking now: leaning on T-bills to fund the deficit. Miran argued at the time that it meant the government was piling up short-term debt that it might have to refinance at much higher costs if interest rates suddenly spike. When reached for comment, Miran, who as Fed governor has been voting for the central bank to aggressively cut rates, declined to comment beyond referring Reuters to a September speech in which he forecast that national borrowing would decline. Stephen Douglass, chief economist of NISA Investment Advisors, said the currency depreciation and spike in yields in the aftermath of Trump's April tariff announcement was something that's typically seen only in emerging markets, and it spooked the administration. ""It has been a meaningful constraint,"" Douglass said.",RELIANCE,RELIANCE.NS,1554.9000244140625,1558.0999755859375,1543.5999755859375,1545.5999755859375,5969577,RELIANCE,2026-01-02,2155936.0,1592.0,1595,55.1,413.0,0.35,7.57,6.61,10.0,0

Reliance Industries,2025-12-30,Fed repo borrowing jumps as quarter-end pressure stirs money market,Economic Times,"Fed repo borrowing jumps as quarter-end pressure stirs money market

A key overnight liquidity facility operated by the US Federal Reserve saw a notable pickup in usage at the start of the week, highlighting renewed demand for short-term funding as markets approach a quarter-end period.Data released by the New York Federal Reserve showed that the central bank lent $25.95 billion on Monday through its standing repo operations. This marked the third-highest level of utilisation since the facility was introduced in 2021 to provide rapid, collateral-backed funding to eligible financial institutions. The loans are secured against US Treasuries or mortgage-backed securities and are extended on an overnight basis.The borrowing was conducted at an interest rate of 3.75%, which sits at the upper end of the Federal Reserve’s current policy rate target range of 3.50% to 3.75%. Elevated usage of the facility often reflects tighter conditions in private funding markets, where borrowing costs can temporarily rise above the rates offered by the central bank.Money markets are prone to bouts of volatility around quarter-end, as banks and financial institutions adjust balance sheets and manage regulatory requirements. The latest usage level was last exceeded on December 1, when borrowing touched $26 billion, and remains well below the all-time high of $50.35 billion recorded on October 31.The standing repo facility was created to act as a liquidity backstop, ensuring that short-term funding markets continue to function smoothly during periods of stress. By offering funding at a known rate against high-quality collateral, the Fed aims to prevent sudden spikes in market rates and reinforce the transmission of monetary policy.Alongside the increase in repo borrowing, data showed a decline in the use of the Fed’s reverse repo facility, where financial institutions park excess cash with the central bank. On Monday, firms placed $10.55 billion in the reverse repo window, down sharply from $20.34 billion on Friday, suggesting a modest shift in liquidity conditions.Together, the movements in the Fed’s repo and reverse repo facilities underscore the dynamic nature of short-term funding markets and the central bank’s role in smoothing liquidity as financial conditions evolve.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.
