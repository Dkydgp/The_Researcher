    "rationale": "Reliance Industries is showing resilience as its price currently sits above the bullish 20-day SMA (₹1551.08) after a recent bounce from this support level. While RSI is neutral, positive news regarding oil sourcing and broader Indian corporate earnings upgrades provide a mild tailwind. In a neutral, medium volatility market regime, we anticipate a cautious upward move for the next day, consolidating above support, with the weekly outlook remaining range-bound but with a slight upward bias."
